# dupe-detector
This Python-based utility scans a specified directory and all its subdirectories to identify duplicate files by comparing their content hashes (SHA-256). It helps users clean up disk space by listing or optionally deleting redundant copies of files. The tool is easy to use via command line and is efficient even for large file systems.
